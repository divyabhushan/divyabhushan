### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ thanks for visiting my profile.

I love to generate various internal/external software documentations following Engineering and business standards, also enjoy writing technical articles.

I have been learning/working on Database, Linux/Unix, SDLC, and Git and teaching others to use them professionally.
