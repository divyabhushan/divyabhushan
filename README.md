### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ thanks for visiting my profile.

I love to generate various internal/external software documentations following Engineering and business standards, also enjoy writing technical articles.

I have been learning/working on Database, Linux/Unix, SDLC, and Git and teaching others to use them professionally. 

I am pleased to share my recent article on [Restrict Web bots crawling on your website while using Docusaurus](https://divya-bhushan.medium.com/where-to-place-the-robots-txt-file-in-your-docusaurus-website-45d18e40e285).

Check out my handy [Linux `chmod` Calculator](https://divyabhushan.github.io/my-app/) :smile:
