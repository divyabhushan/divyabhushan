### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ thanks for visiting my profile.

I love to generate various internal/external software documentations following Engineering and business standards, also enjoy writing technical articles.

I have been learning/working on Database, Linux/Unix, SDLC, and Git and teaching others to use them professionally. 

I am excited to share my recent article [Collapsible list with Bootstrap Accordion](https://divya-bhushan.medium.com/collapsible-list-with-bootstrap-accordion-29e457f4ac2a)

Check out my handy [Linux `chmod` Calculator](https://divyabhushan.github.io/my-app/) :smile:
